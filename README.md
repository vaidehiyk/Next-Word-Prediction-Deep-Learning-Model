# Next-Word-Prediction-Deep-Learning-Model
"A deep learning model that predicts the next word in a sequence using LSTM-based architecture and natural language processing techniques."

📌 Project Overview
This project implements a Next Word Prediction model using Deep Learning and NLP (Natural Language Processing) techniques. The model predicts the most probable next word based on the given input text, mimicking the behavior of text prediction systems in applications like search engines, chat applications, and virtual assistants.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python
TensorFlow / Keras
NLP Techniques (Tokenization, Padding, Embeddings)
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks
NLTK / spaCy for text preprocessing
Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualizations


⚙️ How It Works
Data Preprocessing: Tokenization, cleaning, and sequence generation from text data.
Model Architecture: Uses an LSTM-based neural network for learning word dependencies.
Training: The model is trained on a large text dataset to predict the next word.
Prediction: Given an input sequence, the model predicts the most likely next word.


🚀 Features
✔️ Predicts the next word based on context
✔️ Trained on large text corpora for better accuracy
✔️ Uses LSTM to capture long-term dependencies in text
✔️ Supports different text sources and datasets
